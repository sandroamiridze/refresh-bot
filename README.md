## Introduction

This project demonstrates how to create a simple bot that uses Puppeteer to automate the refreshing of a web page at a specified interval. It's a useful example to understand how browser automation can be accomplished using Puppeteer.

## Installation

1. Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your system.

2. Clone this repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/sandroamiridze/refresh-bot.git
   ```

3. Install the project dependencies:

   ```sh
   cd auto-refresh-bot
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

1. Open the `refreshBot.js` file in a text editor.

2. Replace `'https://example.com'` with the URL of the webpage you want to refresh.

3. In your terminal, run the bot:

   ```sh
   node refreshBot.js
   ```

   This will launch a Puppeteer-controlled browser, navigate to the specified webpage, and refresh it at the defined interval.
